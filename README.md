## Exploratory_Data_Analysis
This is the assignment project (week-1) of Coursera course "Exploratory Data Analysis". It takes data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data set is the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set".

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

* Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
* Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
* Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
* Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
* Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
* Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
* Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
* Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
* Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

## Description:
Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. The task is to reconstruct the following plots, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.
